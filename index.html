        <h2>Welcome to the Card Battle Game!</h2>
        <p>This tutorial will teach you the basics, step by step. Your goal is to reduce your <strong>opponent’s</strong> health to zero before they do the same to you. Let’s dive in!</p>
        
        <h3>What Are Cards?</h3>
        <p>Cards are your tools to fight your opponent. Each card in your hand has:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type</strong>: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. It works like the classic game:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rock beats Scissors.</li>
                    <li>Scissors beat Paper.</li>
                    <li>Paper beats Rock.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Damage</strong>: The number at the <strong>top right</strong> of the card. This shows how much damage it deals if it wins the matchup.</li>
            <li><strong>Mana Cost</strong>: The number at the <strong>bottom left</strong>. This is how much mana you need to play it.</li>
            <li><strong>Abilities</strong>: Some cards have extra effects like Heal, Debuff, or Shield.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Use Your Cards</h3>
        <p>You have two options each turn:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Playing a Card</strong>: Drag a card to the play slot to use it. This costs mana equal to the card’s mana cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Burning a Card</strong>: Drag a card to the burn slot to discard it and gain mana equal to its mana cost.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: Once you drag a card to the play slot, it’s locked in—you can’t undo it.</p>

        <h3>Managing Mana</h3>
        <p>Mana is your energy for playing cards and making moves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You start with 3 mana and gain 3 more each turn (unless you ended with 0 mana, then it resets to 3).</li>
            <li>Spend mana to play cards or burn cards to gain more mana.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tips for Beginners</h3>
        <p>The opponent’s hand is always visible. Use your mana wisely to counter their cards with the best possible combination of your own.</p>

        <p>That’s it! You’re ready to play. Good luck outsmarting your opponent!</p>
